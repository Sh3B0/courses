# DevSecOps

- **Lab 1:** Deploying local GitLab server and runner. Using GitLab CI/CD to push a dockerized Go web application to DockerHub, then deploying the app to a K8s cluster.
- **Lab 2:** Using [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube) with GitLab CI/CD to practice SAST against [DVJA](https://github.com/appsecco/dvja).
- **Lab 3:** Practice GitLab SAST with [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep).
- **Lab 4:** Practice secret detection with [GitLeaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and SAST against [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) and Anchore ([Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)).
- **Lab 5:** Deploy [juice-shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) to a K8s cluster using helm, then run DAST from GitLab CI/CD against the deployed application using [StackHawk](https://www.stackhawk.com/) and [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy).
- **Lab 6:** Practice IAST against juice-shop by bypassing [ModSecurity](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) WAF to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Lab 7:** Using [Faraday](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday) to centrally collect and visualize data generated by running SAST (SonarQube) and DAST (OWASP ZAP) against juice-shop.
