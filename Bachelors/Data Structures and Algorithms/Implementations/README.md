#### Implementations for some popular algorithms and data structures, in Java and C++

- I wrote them to practice what I learnt and to use later as a refresher to recap core ideas.

**These implementations are not ideal**, this means:

1. They are not meant for quick copy&use as they might not cover some edge cases or handle errors properly.
2. They don't offer the best possible performance/memory usage, they just provide the same time complexity as the original algorithms.
3. They might not follow best practices regarding naming variables, indentation, etc...
