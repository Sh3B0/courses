In this assignment, we analyzed the GDPR that enforces data protection in European Union countries. Even though it was intended to govern EU countries only, later on it was adopted by other countries including Turkey, Mauritius, Japan; and others. Here's a summary about it.

- **Main purpose of the document**

  - The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.
  - In other words, it improves people's control on their personal data and guarantee their rights while unifying the process for organizations.

  - The regulation primarily concerns the data of individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) but applies to any enterprise regardless of its location and citizenship/residence of data subjects.

- **Type of information this document is intended to (classification if applicable)**

  - The regulation concerns personal data of individuals, according to GDPR, personal data is defined as:

    > *Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.*

- **Summary of main points and requirements**

  - <u>General provisions</u>
    
    This GDPR is applied to three main categories:
    
    1. **The Controller**: the company or organization that collects that from subjects that are located in the EU.
    2. **The processor**: any company or organization that processes that on behalf of the collector such as a cloud service provider.
    3. **Data subject**: an individual whose data is being collected and currently resides in the EU.
    
    In addition to these three categories, the document states that if the data is purely collected for `personal use` and no connection with professional or commercial business; these rules will not be applied. Moreover, `law enforcement` and `national security` too are exempted from these rules.
    
  - <u>Principles</u>
    
    The main rule mentioned in this document is that the data should only be collected with the full consent of the data subject. In addition to this rule, they are 6 main principles that govern the 3 stated categories above:
    
    1. If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data.
    2. To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract.
    3. To comply with a data controller's legal obligations.
    4. To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual.
    5.  To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority.
    6. For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights.
    
    
    
  - <u>Rights of the data subject</u>

    In addition to the above principles, there are also rights that govern the data subject namely:

    - **Transparency and modalities:**

      The collector should purelly and clearly menition the intent of the collected data.

    - **Information and access**

      The controller and processor should explain how the data is being used.

    - **Rectification and erasure**

      The subject has the right to ask for deletion of his/her data at any time within **30 days of collection**.

    - **Right to object and automated decisions**

      The data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent them from processing his/her own personal data.

  - <u>Rules for the controller and processor</u>

    As this two categories will be in-charge of the data collected, they should be under some rules as summarized below:

    - **Pseudonymisation**

      Transforming data in a way it's not easily visible/accessed by unintended users. For example by encrypting the data.

    - **Records of processing activities**

      The collectors should record how the data was collected.

    - **Security of personal data**

      The collector should secure the data collected to ensure only the intended people are the only ones to access the data.

    - **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** 

      During the collection of data, there should be an experienced person referred to as a DPO who should be in charge of how the data is collected and processed. Any further problems or issues that can arise should be explained by him/her.

    

- **Your contemplation and judgment (conclusion)**

  All in all, as technology advances, there's a high need of data from people as it helps shape new products that can be launched in the tech world. Because of this, companies may be tempted to collect data in unauthorized way from people which would include sensitive information. To help minimize the risk that would arise from all of these; it is a good decision for a country or a community of countries to establish rules that govern the use of data collected from its citizen. Not only does these rules protect the community members but also the overall physical security of a nation or community.
